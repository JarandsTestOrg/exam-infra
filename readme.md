I did task 1, 2 : docker and 3 metrics

## Set up for the program
Remember to set emails and variabels that you might need.
I removed mine since they contained my email.
So check the provider_heroku and statuscake need an email for statuscake username and heroku email
You also need to change git repos in pipeline.yml
